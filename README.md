## 🎯 Purpose

This documentation repository acts as the central knowledge base for the entire ecosystem.  
It ensures clarity, consistency, and long‑term maintainability across all projects.

## 🔄 Integration

This documentation repository is maintained by two automation tools:

- **GitHub Repo Manager**  
  Handles project lifecycle events such as creation, renaming, and archiving.  
  Ensures the Documentation folder always has a corresponding GitHub repository.

- **Push All Projects**  
  Handles ongoing synchronisation, commit workflows, and logging.  
  Ensures all documentation changes are safely committed and pushed.

Together, these tools keep the documentation fully version-controlled and always up to date.
